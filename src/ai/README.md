# Local AI Assistant

The Local AI Assistant provides guidance and support for cybersecurity learning using locally-run AI models. This approach ensures privacy and offline capability.

## Component Structure

- **Model Manager**: Handles loading and switching between AI models
- **Inference Engine**: Processes requests using the loaded models
- **Context System**: Maintains conversation and learning context
- **Response Generator**: Formats AI outputs for different interfaces
- **Knowledge Retrieval**: Finds relevant information from local knowledge base

## Implementation Status

This component is currently in the planning phase. Initial implementation will focus on integration with Ollama for local model execution.

## Development Focus

The initial development will focus on creating a simple, efficient AI assistant using local models:

1. Ollama integration for model management
2. Basic inference with context retention
3. Command-line interface for interaction
4. Simple knowledge retrieval from local files

## Limitations

The local AI assistant has the following limitations:

1. Limited by local model size and capabilities
2. Restricted to locally available knowledge
3. No internet access for fact-checking
4. Resource usage dependent on local hardware
